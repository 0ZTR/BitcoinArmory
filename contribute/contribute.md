Contributing to Armory can be done through submitting code via Pull Requests, reviewing code, and submitting bug reports.

### Contribute and Review code

Fork the the source code, typically the [dev branch](https://github.com/goatpig/BitcoinArmory/tree/dev), to a topic branch in your own repo. Write your patch and then submit a Pull Request. The code will be reviewed by other developers and the merged in by the project lead.

To review code, simply choose a Pull Request to review and read over the changes made by the PR. Leave comments if there is anything that you think should be different.
