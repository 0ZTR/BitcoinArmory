Things that need to be done for Armory are listed here. Feel free to choose one and begin working on it, just check that no one else is working on the same thing.

 - Segwit wallets (wait for goatpig to finish the new wallets)
 - Make all strings displayed in the GUI use the `tr()` function of Qt in order to facilitate translations.
 - Remove and replace all references to bitcoinarmory.com with btcarmory.com
