Armory Technologies Incorporated has decided to [discontinue the development](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1351792.0) of the open source Bitcoin Armory software. Development has [instead been passed](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1351924.0) into the good hands of goatpig and the rest of the Bitcoin Community with no further support from ATI.

Bitcoin Armory will continue to be developed and maintained by @goatpig. Due to licensing issues, the 0.94, the next version of Armory, will need to be rewritten from scratch. The following is the current plan:

>   1) 0.94 DB changes  
2) BIP32/44 support  
3) SegWit and RBF support (hopefully Im [goatpig] done with the new wallets before SegWit goes live on the mainnet)  
4) Everything else  

Licensing
---------
GNU Affero General Public License Version 3. Any code written up to the 0.93.3 release is licesned under the GNU Affero General Public License Version 3 to Armory Technologies Incorporated. Following this change, any further code added to Armory will be licensed under the MIT License.
