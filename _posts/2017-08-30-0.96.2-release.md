This release is a minor release introducing many bug fixes and some new features. This release also contains support for Segregated Witness on the main Bitcoin network and support for signing Bitcoin Cash transactions.

## Compatibility

Armory 0.96.0 introduced new output script types, P2SH-P2PK and P2SH-P2WPKH. Spending from these output types requires Armory 0.96.0+. The standard P2PKH output types are still created and can be signed for by previous versions dating back to Armory 0.92.x.

## Notable Changes

### Segregated Witness Support on Mainnet

Since Segregated Witness has activated on mainnet, Armory now allows for the creation of P2SH nested segwit addresses (P2SH-P2WPKH) provided that the full node that it is connected to signals for segwit support via having the NODE_WITNESS service bit set. Using Bitcoin Core 0.13.1 or later will allow these addresses to be made.

### Bitcoin Cash Support

Since the replay protection used by Bitcoin Cash is simply using part of segwit, Armory has now implemented support for creating Bitcoin Cash transactions. Note that this was only done because it was fairly simple to do, the Armory developers may not continue to support Bitcoin Cash should any more drastic changes be made. For more information about how to create Bitcoin Cash transactions, please read [this Bitcointalk.org post](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2070058.0)

### Additional Expert Mode Options

If you choose to use the Expert Mode, there are now additional options when sending transactions. There are now choices for which signer to use (C++ signer for segwit and Bitcoin Cash or Python signer for legacy transactions) when sending Bitcoin and an option to create OP_RETURN outputs from the Send Bitcoin dialog.

### Maximum Spend Checkbox

The option to spend the entire selected balance has been changed from a button to a checkbox. This allows you to choose to send the maximum and then change the transaction fee without having to click the Max button again to get the new maximum.

## Full changelog

### Added
- Enabled SegWit on the mainnet. Running against a node with WITNESS service bit flagged will allow you to create SegWit addresses.
- Improved DB scan speed (~80% faster) and stability.
- Reduced DB memory usage (~20% less).
- Supernode DB mode. This isn't optimized for consumer grade computers, use at your own risk.
- The MAX button in the Send dialog has been changed to a checkbox, effect is now binding. 
  Maximum value will be calculated on any change.
- You can now create OP_RETURN outputs from the Send dialog. This feature is only available in Expert mode.
- You can now pick the signer of your choosing in Expert mode.
- Added BCH on top of the legacy and 0.96 C++ signer.
- Improved verbose on ZC broadcast failure.

### Fixed
- Fixed benchmark timers on POSIX systems.
- Fixed several Linux build configure bugs.
- Properly update RPC state in GUI on connect/disconnect events.
- Various zero conf bugs.
- Scan progress notification.
- Properly display comments for non legacy addresses.
- Digital exports will be saved under the proper file extention in Windows.
