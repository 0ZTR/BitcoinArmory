Notable Changes
===============

Implemented low S-value signatures to work with Core 0.11+:
-----------------------------------------------------------
Armory now implements all components of BIP62 compliance in its signing code. Also includes a correction path to fix non-compliant signatures when broadcasting transactions signed by older versions of Armory. Thus, offline systems do not need to be updated, as long as the online system is.

Critical Bug Fix: "bitcoin:" URI handling of Multisig/P2SH addresses:
------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
The code that handles clicking on a "bitcoin:" link outside Armory was improperly handling Multisig/P2SH addresses, and would prefill a valid but incorrect address.

Transaction confirmation fix: 
-----------------------------
The number of confirmations was not being calculated properly for fee estimation in some contexts.
